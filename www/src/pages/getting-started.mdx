# Getting Started

<p>
  <Brand>astroturf</Brand> lets you write CSS in your JavaScript files without
  adding any runtime layer, and with your existing CSS processing pipeline.
</p>

- **Zero runtime CSS-in-JS.** Get many of the same benefits as CSS-in-JS,
  but without the loss of flexibility in requiring framework-specific CSS
  processing, and while keeping your CSS fully static with no runtime style parsing.
- Use your existing tools – **Sass, PostCSS, Less** – but still write
  your style definitions in your JavaScript files
- **Whole component in the single file**. Write CSS in a template literal,
  then use it as if it were in a separate file

## Usage

A goal of <Brand>astroturf</Brand> is to provide approachable
scoped and managable CSS according to everyone's level of comfort. Pick the level of
abstraction that is right for _you_!

### Scoped StyleSheets

Leavaging the <Brand>MAGIC</Brand> of compilation, astroturf lets you define styles
from the comfort of your JavaScript (or TypeScript) files; Framework optional!

```jsx
import { stylesheet } from 'astroturf';

const height = 2;

const styles = stylesheet`
  .btn {
    appearance: none;
    height: ${height}rem;
    display: inline-block;
    padding: .5rem 1rem;
  }

  .primary {
    color: white:
    border: 1px solid white;
    background-color: taupe;

    &:hover {
      color: taupe:
      border-color: taupe;
      background-color: white;
    }
  }
`;

const Button = ({ primary }) => {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.classList.add(styles.btn, primary && styles.primary);
  return button;
};
```

Through our proprietary "Extraction Process" each stylesheet is
turned into it's own CSS file.

For those who like a more <Brand>MODULAR</Brand> approach the `css` tag is ready and
waiting. The `css` tag creates single CSS classes:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

const btn = css`
  color: black;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: white;
`;

export default function Button({ children }) {
  return <button className={btn}>{children}</button>;
}
```

When processed, the `css` block will be extracted into a `.css` file,
taking advantage of any and all of the other loaders configured to handle css.

## React!

Embracing the component lifestyle? <Brand>astroturf</Brand> has you covered with
built-in integration with <Brand>React.JS™</Brand>. The versitile `css` tag helps
transform your plain ol' components into bueatiful works of art.

```jsx noFormat
import * as React from 'react';
import { css } from 'astroturf';

function Button({ variant, bgColor, children }) {
  return (
    <button
      css={css`
        color: black;
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: ${bgColor};

        ${variant === 'primary' &&
        css`
          color: blue;
          border: 1px solid blue;
        `}

        ${variant === 'secondary' &&
        css`
          color: green;
        `}
      `}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```
